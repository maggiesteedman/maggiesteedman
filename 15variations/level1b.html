<p> <br> <br> Animal rights is the movement to protect animals from being used or regarded as property by human beings </p>
<p> <br> <br> It is a radical social movement insofar as it aims not only to attain more humane treatment for animals </p>
<p> <br> <br> but also to include species other than human beings within the moral community by giving their basic interests </p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For example: </p>
<p> <br> <br> the interest in avoiding suffering </p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the same consideration as those of human beings </p>
<p> <br> <br> <br> The claim is that animals should no longer be regarded legally or morally as property </p>
<p> <br> or treated as resources for human purposes </p>
<p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> but should instead be regarded as persons </p>
