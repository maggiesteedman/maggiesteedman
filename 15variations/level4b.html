    <p> <strong> Animal rights is </strong> </p>
    <p> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the movement to protect </p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; animals from being used or regarded as property </p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by human beings </p>
    <p> <br> It is a radical social movement </p>
    <p> insofar as it aims not only to attain more humane treatment for animals </p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but also to include species other than human beings </p>
    <p> within the moral community </p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by giving their basic interests </p>
    <p> <em> for example </em>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the interest in avoiding suffering </p>
    <p> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong> the same consideration as those of human beings. </strong> </p>
    <p> <br> The claim is that <p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; animals should no longer be regarded legally or morally <p>
    <p> as property </p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or treated as resources </p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for human purposes </p>
    <p> <em> but should instead </em> </p>
    <p> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong> be regarded as persons. </strong> </p>
