<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the movement to protect animals from being used or regarded as property by human beings </p> <br>

<p> but also to include species other than human beings within the moral community by giving their basic interests </p> <br>
<p> <strong> for example... </strong> </p>

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or treated as resources for human purposes <p/>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but should instead be regarded as persons </p> <br> <br>
