<p> <h4> Humans 04 Manifesto </h4> </p>
<p> <ol> </p>
<p> <li> Animal rights is the movement to protect animals from being used or regarded as property by human beings </li> </p>
<p> <li> It is a radical social movement insofar as it aims not only to attain more humane treatment for animals </li> </p>
<p> <li> but also to include species other than human beings within the moral community by giving their basic interests </li> </p>
<p> </ol> </p>
<p> <br> <br> <strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example </strong> </p>
<p> <ol> </p>
<p> <ul> </p>
<p> <li> the interest in avoiding suffering </li> </p>
<p> <li> the same consideration as those of human beings </li> </p>
<p> </ul> </p>
<p> <br> <li> The claim is that animals should no longer be regarded legally or morally as property </li> </p>
<p> <li> Or treated as resources for human purposes </li> </p>
<p> <li> But should instead be regarded as persons </li> </p>
