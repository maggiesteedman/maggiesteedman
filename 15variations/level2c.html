  <div> <h4> Animal rights is the movement to protect animals from being used or regarded as property by human beings. </h4> </div> <p>
  <p> It is a <strong> radical </strong> social movement insofar as it aims not only to attain more <em> humane treatment </em> for animals, but also to include species other than human beings within the <strong> moral </strong> community by giving their basic interests. <strong> <em> For example: </em> </strong> the interest in avoiding suffering—the <strong> same </strong> consideration as those of human beings. The claim is that animals should no longer be regarded legally or morally as <em> property, </em> or treated as <em> resources </em> for human purposes, but should instead be regarded as <strong> persons. <strong> <p>
